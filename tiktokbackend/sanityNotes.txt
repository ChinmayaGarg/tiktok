schemas folder:
This folder contains the schema of the data.

fields: The fields key of schema is to tell what fields to show. This takes in array.

"type:'reference'": This means it is going to connect 2 different documents. With type as reference,
another key i.e. "to" is important which tells us -> connect to what/reference to what.
Eg: Schema of postedBy - This will refer to "user". 
    Sanity checks all schemas with "name" key having "user".
			export default {
				name: 'postedBy',
				title: 'Posted By',
				type: 'reference',
				to: [{type: 'user'}],
			}

"type:'array'": Similarly when we give type as array, we need to specify array of what?
				Hence "of" key is mandatory when type:array is declared.
