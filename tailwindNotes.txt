tailwind refresher

Eg:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
h1 {
  color: purple;
}

@tailwind is not a valid CSS syntax. But, tailwind uses these directives (as they are called) to generate the built CSS. 
h1 will also be added to the stylesheet as-is.

"@tailwind"'s "@" comes from at-rules for CSS that instructs CSS how to behave.
Use the @tailwind directive to insert Tailwindâ€™s base, components, utilities and variants styles into your CSS.

1. @tailwind base;
This injects Tailwind's base styles and any base styles registered by plugins.

2. @tailwind components;
This injects Tailwind's component classes and any component classes registered by plugins.

3.@tailwind utilities;
This injects Tailwind's utility classes and any utility classes registered by plugins.

4. @tailwind variants;
Use this directive to control where Tailwind injects the hover, focus,
responsive, dark mode, and other variants of each class.
If omitted, Tailwind will append these classes to the very end of your stylesheet by default.

How to configure the tailwing using tailwind.config,js?
Because, Tailwind is a framework for building bespoke user interfaces, 
it has been designed from the ground up with customization in mind.

By default, Tailwind will look for an optional tailwind.config.js file 
at the root of your project where you can define any customizations.

Content:
The content section is where you configure the paths to all of your HTML templates, JS components, and any other files that contain Tailwind class names.
